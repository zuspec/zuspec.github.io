<h1 id="zuspec">Zuspec</h1>
<p>Zuspec, a portmanteu of zusammen (German for “together”) and specification, 
is a suite of tools for working with action-relation-level (ARL) modeling 
descriptions. These descriptions enable co-specification of design and
test functionality, as well as co-specification of hardware and software
aspects of a design. Of course, Zuspec also enables use of ARL modeling
descriptions targeting a single domain – for example, embedded software
tests for SoC-level verification.</p>

<p>Zuspec is currently in its infancy, with most effort going toward
infrastructure development. Watch this space for more details.</p>
