# Zuspec
Zuspec, a portmanteau of zusammen (German for "together") and specification, 
is a Python-based multi-abstraction hardware modeling language and a suite of 
tools for working with Zuspec models.

Zuspec is currently in its infancy, with most effort going toward
infrastructure development. Watch this space for more details.
