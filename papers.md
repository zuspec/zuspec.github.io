# Zuspec: Pythonic Model-Driven Hardware Development

**Abstract** - Designing and implementing hardware is challenging, and is getting more 
difficult each year as systems become more complex. Design and verification 
teams are looking to boost productivity as a way to keep pace, 
while also looking for ways to provide models of the design behavior to 
software teams earlier. The fragmented and esoteric nature of the languages 
and methodologies used for design and verification only make this more difficult. 
Zuspec is a unified, extensible Pythonic framework for multi-abstraction 
hardware modeling that simplifies the design and verification process and 
enables traditional and AI-driven automation.
