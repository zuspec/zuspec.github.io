<p>The abstraction gap and model fragmentation are two key drivers of hardware
design-flow complexity. The abstraction difference between a 
natural-language design specification and the register-transfer-level (RTL) 
model that implements it is enormous, and only increasing as designs 
become larger and more complex. It’s natural to prioritize the 
RTL model, since that is required to get to implementation. However, 
because RTL models are detailed and execute slowly, they don’t do a good job of
meeting the needs of adjacent disciplines, such as firmware. 
This delays how early software teams obtain access to a representation of the design,
and limits the platforms on which they can work to fast hardware emulation
or prototyping environments.</p>

<p>Over time, new requirements have resulted in the development of new 
domain-specific languages and language-like class libraries. SystemVerilog, 
PSS, UPF, IP-XACT, SystemC, and others all provide features that address pain 
points of hardware development.  Unfortunately, this has also led to a very 
fragmented ecosystem with loosely-integrated languages and methodologies and 
complex build flows.</p>

<h1 id="considering-the-ecosystem">Considering the Ecosystem</h1>

<p>All of these innovations have primarily come from a hardware-design 
perspective, and focus on enabling hardware-design flows. That,
in itself, is a challenge given the relative sizes of the 
hardware- and software-engineering ecosystems. While it’s 
difficult to find accurate detailed data, US Bureau of Labor 
Statistics reports a labor-market size of 76,800 for hardware 
engineers vs a labor-market size of 1,534,790 for software 
engineers (inclusive of all sub-disciplines in both cases).</p>

<p>Given that the collective challenge is a combined hardware and 
software system, getting buy-in from both disciplines is critical.
It seems quite unlikely that a language created to serve the unique
requirements of the ecosystem’s minority can serve the combined
needs and gain the acceptance of the majority.</p>

<h1 id="zuspec">Zuspec</h1>

<p>Zuspec ^[https://zuspec.github.io/] adopts Python as its starting 
point, and embeds hardware semantics into that ecosystem. The result 
is a platform that is familiar to software engineers, offers 
high productivity for hardware engineering, and has the goal of 
increasing the ability to share artifacts across the disciplines.</p>

<h2 id="why-python">Why Python?</h2>

<p>Many factors are involved in selecting a language for any purpose: 
key language features, tool ecosystem, relevant libraries, as well
as the community around the language. Applying an existing language to the 
semantics of another  domains raises another factor to consider: 
flexibility of the language.</p>

<h3 id="popularity-can-be-self-reinforcing">Popularity can be Self-Reinforcing</h3>

<p>Python is a popular language overall, holding the top spot in many
rankings for several consecutive years, and being ranked highly 
for many years before that. Language popularity may not seem relevant
compared to the technical features of a language. Not only it is 
relevant, popularity has a direct bearing on language technical
features. TIOBE ^[https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/], for example, 
measures language rank in terms of searches via a range of internet 
search engines ^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TIOBE_index]. This is, 
of course, a rough measure a the size of a language’s community. Larger
communities produce more ideas for using a language and, thus,
a a larger library ecosystem. Larger communities more-rapidly
produce and refine adjacent technologies, such as code 
development and package management tools, and new language features.</p>

<p>Popularity often builds upon itself, and there is evidence that 
AI is acting as a driver of Python’s popularity.
Specifically, AI assistants are often reported to be more 
effective with Python than with other languages ^[https://www.perplexity.ai/page/ai-generates-up-to-30-of-micro-Iy6zscIfSy6miYtIqvrsMA].
This has the effect of drawing more developers to Python, which
increases the available code in Python, which more-rapidly
increases the quality of results with Python.</p>

<p>But, language popularity is only relevant for the set of languages
that can be used to capture relevant domain semantics. Fortunately,
Python measures up very well here again.</p>

<h3 id="technical-arguments-for-python">Technical Arguments for Python</h3>

<p>There are strong technical arguments for the Python language as well.
As a dynamic language, Python provides excellent facilities for 
introspecting and manipulating a Python description.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Python <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">decorators</code> can be used to annotate elements of the description,
identifying specific semantics to be applied to an element or attaching
special processing instructions. For example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">constraint</code> decorator
above marks the body of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">valid_sz</code> method as having constraint 
semantics.</p>

<p>Python also allows inheritance relationships to be inspected at any
point in time. The base type controls capabilities and restrictions
of the derived type.</p>

<p>While Python can be used as a purely dynamically-typed language, it 
also provides the ability to associate type “hints” with variables. 
The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sz</code> field in the example above specifies that it is an unsigned
8-bit field. This enables the modeler to control how data in the
model will be represented in the implementation.</p>

<p>Finally, Python supports AST introspection and transformation. This 
capability allows tools to access the raw AST for code, such as 
the constraint method above, without needing to use tricks like 
operator overloading.</p>

<p>Statically-typed languages often provide some introspection facilities
that are available during the compilation phase. In contrast, Python 
allows these facilities to be applied to a Python description at any 
point in time, providing much more flexibility in processing flows. 
Effectively, Python allows libraries like Zuspec to act as a compiler
within the Python interpreter.</p>

<p>Python also offers a strong set of system-programming features.
Combined with Python’s dynamic language features, these dramatically
simplify the process of integrating external tools and systems.</p>

<p>Python also specifies a package specification and provides tools
for producing, discovering, and consuming packages.</p>

<p>Together, these capabilities make Python a very compelling platform 
for developing, verifying, and publishing hardware models.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-this-look-like">What does this look like?</h1>

<p>All languages are a combination of syntax and semantics. Syntax 
governs the lexical aspects of a language: the keywords, operators,
and legal ways of arranging them. Semantics governs the meanings of
those statements – for example, whether <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a = b</code> changes the value
of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> variable, changes the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">a</code> variable to reference
the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">b</code> variable, or something entirely different. Zuspec proposes
a way to adopt full Python syntax, while identifying key regions
in which different semantics apply to this syntax. These new semantics
are always more restrictive than native Python semantics, allowing
existing code checkers (eg mypy) to work unmodified.</p>

<p>Zuspec divides a Python description into two core region kinds:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pure Python regions</li>
  <li>Python regions with domain-specific semantics</li>
</ul>

<p>Even a simple binary counter highlights several unique semantics that 
a hardware description must capture:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bit width of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">count</code> field</li>
  <li>When the count should be incremented</li>
  <li>Hardware-specific notions like reset</li>
</ul>

<p>Zuspec identifies regions with these semantics using a combination of
Python <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">decorators</code> and base classes. The example below shows a 
32-bit counter modeled using the Zuspec library.</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">zuspec.dataclasses</span> <span class="k">as</span> <span class="n">zdc</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Counter</code> example above illustrates these two regions. By default,
pure Python semantics are used. Consequently, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">import</code> statement
at the top uses pure Python semantics.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Counter</code> class inherits from the Zuspec <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Component</code> class, which
designates it as a class with specific capabilities.  The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">inc</code> method
is decorated with the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sync</code> decorator. This marks it as a method that
is automatically evaluated on the active edge of the specified 
clock or reset signals, and a method where deferred assignment is used.
It also marks it as a method that may not be invoked directly.</p>

<p>A class domain with special semantics is a model of implementation, 
and cannot be used directly. Instead, a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Transformer</code> class 
must first be used to create an implementation. In this case, the 
implementation could be pure-Python, Verilog, or something entirely 
different like documentation.</p>

<p>The example above shows a small testbench around the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Counter</code> 
component with a simple <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Pytest</code> unit test. The type transformer 
creates a Python object that is used to dynamically evaluate
the model. While the interface is Python, the implementation
may or may not be Python. For example, the transformer might, 
instead, transform the model to Verilog and create a Verilator 
^[https://www.veripool.org/verilator/]
simulator executable that evaluates the model much faster than
a pure-Python implementation, while still exposing a Python 
interface to the signals.</p>

<p>Another transformer might convert the model to the synthesizable

<h1 id="the-user-extensible-language">The User-Extensible Language</h1>

<p>The <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Counter</code> example is quite simple, and at the register-transfer level (RTL).
Zuspec is designed to be able to capture a broad range of 
hardware-centric semantics that cover:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Verification
    <ul>
      <li>Constrained randomization and functional coverage</li>
      <li>Portable test and stimulus (PSS)</li>
      <li>Assertions (SVA)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Hardware design
    <ul>
      <li>RTL</li>
      <li>Medium-level synthesis</li>
      <li>Transaction-level modeling (TLM)</li>
      <li>Register modeling</li>
      <li>Clock and power domains</li>
      <li>Physical design</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Firmware
    <ul>
      <li>Register interface</li>
      <li>Specialized memory management</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Zuspec brings a new approach to domain-specific languages that leverages the 
popularity and ecosystem of Python, and embeds domain-specific semantics from
hardware design, verification, and firmware. The big “bet” is that educating
humans and LLMs on the delta between a Python and a set of domain-specific
semantics is far easier than doing the same with a completely new language.</p>

<p>While Zuspec models are captured in Python, processing tools may transform Zuspec 
models into appropriate non-Python implementations such as embedded C or 
synthesizable Verilog.  Zuspec encourages a Pythonic development process for 
hardware that is code-centric, AI-friendly, and nimble. And, most importantly, 
Zuspec provides togetherness: a common environment in which new language 
innovations can be explored along with integrated existing technologies.</p>
